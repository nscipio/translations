There was no one in him; behind his face (which even through the bad paintings of the era[^1^] does not resemble any other) and his words, which were copious, fantastic, and agitated, there was nothing more than a little cold, a dream not dreamed by anyone. At first, he believed that all people were like him, but the strangeness of a companion with whom he had begun to comment on that emptiness revealed his mistake and let him feel, forever, that an individual should not differ from the species. At some point, he thought that in books he would find a remedy for his ailment and thus he learned the little Latin and even less Greek that a contemporary would speak; then he considered that in the practice of an elemental rite of humanity, what he was looking for could well be there, and he let himself be initiated by Anne Hathaway[^2^], during a long siesta in June. In his early twenties, he went to London. Instinctively, he had already trained himself in the habit of pretending to be someone, so his condition of being no one would not be discovered; in London, he found the profession to which he was predestined, that of an actor, who on a stage, plays at being another, in front of a group of people who play to take him for that other. The theatrical tasks taught him a unique happiness, perhaps the first he knew; but once the final verse was met with acclaim and the last dead removed from the stage, the hated taste of unreality fell upon him. He stopped being Ferrex[^3^] or Tamerlane[^4^] and returned to being no one. Besieged, he began to imagine other heroes and other tragic fables. Thus, while the body fulfilled its destiny of a body, in brothels and taverns of London, the soul that inhabited it was Caesar, who ignores the augur's warning, and Juliet, who abhors the lark, and Macbeth, who converses on the moor with the witches who are also the Fates[^5^]. No one was as many men as that man, who, like the Egyptian Proteus[^6^], could exhaust all possible forms of existence. At times, he left a confession in some corner of the work, certain that they would not decipher it; Richard asserts that in his single person, he plays the role of many, and Iago says with curious words, "I am not what I am". The fundamental identity of existing, dreaming, and performing inspired his famous passages.

For twenty years he persisted in that directed hallucination, but one morning he was overtaken by the weariness and horror of being so many kings who die by the sword and so many unfortunate lovers who converge, diverge, and melodiously agonize. That same day he resolved the sale of his theater[^7^]. Before a week had passed, he had returned to his hometown, where he rediscovered the trees and river of his childhood and did not link them to those others that his muse had celebrated, illustrious of mythological allusion and Latin voices. He had to be someone; he was a retired businessman who had made a fortune and was interested in loans, litigation, and small usury. In that character, he dictated the barren testament[^8^] that we know, from which he deliberately excluded any pathetic or literary feature. His friends from London often visited him in his retreat, and for them, he resumed the role of the poet.

The story adds that, before or after dying, he found himself before God and said: “I, who have been so many men in vain, want to be one and myself”. God's voice answered him from a whirlwind: “I am not either; I dreamed the world as you dreamed your work, my Shakespeare, and among the forms of my dream you were there, who like me are many and nobody”.

[^1^]: This phrase refers to the fact that no reliable portraits of William Shakespeare exist. The most famous is the Chandos portrait, whose authenticity is debated.
[^2^]: Anne Hathaway was the wife of William Shakespeare. They married when he was eighteen and she was twenty-six.
[^3^]: Ferrex is a character from the play "Gorboduc", which is considered one of the sources of inspiration for Shakespeare's "King Lear".
[^4^]: Tamerlane, also known as Timur, was a brutal conqueror who established a powerful empire in the late 14th century. Shakespeare did not write a play about Tamerlane, but he is mentioned in "Tamburlaine" by Christopher Marlowe, a contemporary of Shakespeare.
[^5^]: The Fates, or Moirai, are the three goddesses of fate in Greek mythology. In Shakespeare's Macbeth, they are represented by the three witches.
[^6^]: Proteus is a god from Greek mythology known for his ability to change forms.
[^7^]: Shakespeare was a shareholder of the Globe Theatre in London.
[^8^]: The testament refers to Shakespeare's will, which is indeed quite practical and mundane.
