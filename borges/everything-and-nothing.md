Within him, no one existed; behind his face, which, even through the imperfect depictions of his era, bore resemblance to none other, and behind his words, which were abundant, fantastical, and turbulent, there was nothing more than a touch of cold, a dream not dreamt by anyone. Initially, he considered that all people were akin to him, but the surprise a friend expressed when he began to discuss this void disclosed his misconception and allowed him to perceive, indefinitely, that an individual should not deviate from their species. Once, he assumed he might unearth a remedy for his condition in books, hence he mastered the meager Latin and even lesser Greek that a contemporary might converse about; later he contemplated that in the execution of an elementary rite of humanity, he could find what he sought and thus, he allowed himself to be initiated by Anne Hathaway during a long, languid June siesta. In his early twenties, he journeyed to London. Instinctively, he had already become adept in the guise of being someone else, so as not to expose his state of being no one; in London, he discovered the vocation he was fated for - that of an actor, who on a stage, feigns to be another before a crowd of spectators who pretend to accept him as that other. The histrionic tasks proffered him an unprecedented joy, perhaps the first he ever truly felt; but once the final verse was acclaimed and the last fallen character had departed the scene, the despised flavor of unreality descended upon him once more. He ceased to be Ferrex or Tamburlaine, reverting to being no one. Harried, he took to conjuring other heroes and other tragic tales. Thus, while his body satisfied its earthly desires in brothels and taverns of London, the soul inhabiting him donned the roles of Julius Caesar, dismissing the augur's warning; Juliet, who loathes the lark; and Macbeth, engaging in moorland discourse with the witches who also personify the Fates. No one was as multifaceted as this man, who, like the Egyptian Proteus, could exhaust all possible forms of existence. At times, he tucked a confession into some recess of his play, confident that it would remain undeciphered; Richard avows that in his single persona, he assumes many roles, and Iago utters with curious words "I am not what I am". The intrinsic correlation of existence, dreaming, and acting inspired his most renowned passages.

For twenty years he persevered in that purposeful delusion, but one morning he was besieged by the weariness and horror of being so many kings dying by the sword and so many luckless lovers who converge, diverge, and melodiously agonize. On that very day, he resolved to divest himself of his theater. Within a week, he had returned to his birthplace, where he reacquainted himself with the trees and river of his childhood, careful not to link them with the others his muse had glorified, illustrious with mythological references and Latin echoes. He had to become someone; he transformed into a retired entrepreneur who had accrued a fortune and showed an interest in loans, litigations, and petty usury. In this guise, he dictated the stark will we now know, intentionally devoid of any trace of pathos or literature. Friends from London would frequently visit his seclusion, and for their sake, he would reassume the persona of a poet.

Historical accounts suggest that, either before or after his death, he found himself standing before God and proclaimed, "I, who have fruitlessly been so many men, I wish to be one and myself." From within a whirlwind, God's voice responded, "I, too, am not what I seem; I dreamt the world just as you dreamt your work, my Shakespeare, and among the forms of my dream, you were there, who, like me, are manifold and no one."
