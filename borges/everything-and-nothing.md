No one was in him; behind his countenance (which, even through the poor paintings of the era, bore no resemblance to any other) and his words, abundant, fantastical, and agitated, there was naught but a touch of coldness, a dream undreamed by anyone. Initially, he believed that all people were like him, but the puzzlement of a companion with whom he had begun to discuss this emptiness revealed his error and left him forever with the sense that an individual should not differ from the species. At some point, he thought that within books, he might find a remedy for his ailment. Thus, he learned the little Latin and even less Greek that a contemporary would speak. Later, he considered that the solution could lie in the practice of an elemental rite of humanity and allowed himself to be initiated by Anne Hathaway during a long siesta in June. In his early twenties, he went to London. Instinctively, he had already trained himself in the habit of pretending to be someone, so that his condition of being nobody would not be discovered. In London, he discovered the vocation to which he was predestined: that of an actor who, upon a stage, plays at being another, before an audience that plays at taking him for that other. The theatrical tasks taught him a singular happiness, perhaps the first he ever knew. But as the final verse was acclaimed and the last dead body removed from the stage, the loathed taste of unreality fell upon him. He ceased to be Ferrex or Tamerlane and returned to being nobody. Besieged, he began to imagine other heroes and other tragic fables. Thus, while his body fulfilled its destiny as a body, in brothels and taverns of London, the soul that inhabited it was Caesar, who ignores the augur's warning, and Juliet, who abhors the lark, and Macbeth, who converses on the moor with the witches, who are also the Fates. No one was as many men as that man, who, like the Egyptian Proteus, could exhaust all the appearances of being. Sometimes, he left a confession in some corner of his work, certain that they would not decipher it; Richard asserts that within his singular person, he plays the roles of many, and Iago says with curious words, "I am not what I am." The fundamental identity of existing, dreaming, and performing inspired his famous passages.

For twenty years, he persisted in this directed hallucination, but one morning weariness and horror overwhelmed him. The burden of being so many kings who die by the sword and so many unfortunate lovers who converge, diverge, and melodiously agonize became too much. On that same day, he resolved to sell his theater. Before a week had passed, he returned to his hometown, where he rediscovered the trees and the river of his childhood, without linking them to those others that his muse had celebratedâ€”illustrious with mythological allusions and Latin voices. He had to be someone; he became a retired businessman who had made a fortune and was interested in loans, litigation, and petty usury. In that character, he dictated the barren will that we know, deliberately excluding any pathetic or literary feature. Friends from London often visited him in his retreat, and for them, he resumed the role of the poet.

The story adds that, before or after his death, he found himself before God and said, "I, who have been so many men in vain, want to be one and myself." God's voice answered him from a whirlwind, "I am not either; I dreamed the world as you dreamed your work, my Shakespeare, and among the forms of my dream, you were there, who like me are many and nobody."
