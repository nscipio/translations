There was no one within him; beyond his countenance (which, even in the meager paintings of that era, resembled no other) and his abundant, imaginative, and impassioned words, there resided naught but a faint chill—a dream unrealized by any. Initially, he believed that everyone was akin to himself, but the bewilderment of a companion with whom he had begun to discuss this emptiness unveiled his error and forever impressed upon him that an individual should not deviate from the collective. At a certain point, he surmised that a remedy for his affliction might be found within books. He acquired a modicum of Latin and even less Greek, as spoken by contemporaries. Then, he contemplated that the practice of a fundamental rite of humanity could offer an answer. During a languid siesta in June, he allowed himself to be initiated by Anne Hathaway. In his early twenties, he journeyed to London. Having already honed the skill of assuming another's identity, he ensured his condition of being a nobody remained concealed. In London, he discovered the vocation that had been destined for him: that of an actor, who, upon the stage, plays the role of another, before an audience who plays along, mistaking him for that other. The theatrical endeavors bestowed upon him a singular happiness, perhaps the first he had ever known. However, once the final verse was met with acclaim and the last corpse removed from the stage, the detested taste of unreality descended upon him. He ceased to be Ferrex or Tamerlane, and once again became a nobody. Enveloped, he began to envision other heroes and tragic tales. Thus, while his physical form fulfilled its role as a body, amidst the brothels and taverns of London, the soul that inhabited it assumed the guise of Caesar, who disregards the augur's warning, and Juliet, who despises the lark, and Macbeth, who converses on the moor with the witches, who are also the Fates. No other person embodied as many men as he did—a man who, akin to the Egyptian Proteus, exhausted every conceivable form of existence. On occasion, he would leave a confession in some obscure corner of his work, confident that it would remain undeciphered. Richard affirms that within his singular being, he embodies the roles of many, and Iago proclaims with curious words, "I am not what I am." The fundamental identity of existing, dreaming, and performing inspired his celebrated passages.

For two decades, he persisted in this directed hallucination, until one morning, weariness and horror overcame him. The burden of embodying countless kings who perish by the sword and innumerable ill-fated lovers who converge, diverge, and melodiously agonize became overwhelming. On that very day, he resolved to sell his theater. Before a week had passed, he had returned to his hometown, where he rediscovered the trees and river of his childhood, unlinked from the others that his muse had extolled—illustrious with mythological allusions and Latin voices. He yearned to become someone; he became a retired businessman who had amassed a fortune, engrossed in loans, litigation, and petty usury. In this guise, he dictated the barren will we know of today, deliberately omitting any pathos or literary flourish. His friends from London often visited him in his retreat, and for their sake, he resumed the role of the poet.

The tale continues that, before or after his demise, he found himself in the presence of God and uttered, "I, who have been so many men in vain, long to be but one—myself." From amidst a whirlwind, God's voice responded, "I too am not singular; I dreamt the world just as you dreamt your works, my Shakespeare, and among the forms of my dream, you were there—a multitude like me, and yet nobody."
