In him, there was no one; behind his face (which, even in the flawed paintings of the time, resembles none other), and his words, which were plentiful, fantastical, and turbulent, there was nothing more than a touch of cold, a dream not dreamed by anyone. At first, he believed that all people were like him, but the surprise expressed by a companion with whom he had begun to discuss this emptiness revealed his mistake and left him to feel, forever, that an individual should not diverge from their species. Once, he thought that in books he would find a remedy for his affliction and so he learned the scant Latin and even less Greek that a contemporary might speak; then he considered that in the performance of an elemental rite of humanity, there might be what he was seeking, and he allowed himself to be initiated by Anne Hathaway, during a long June siesta. In his early twenties, he went to London. Instinctively, he had already trained himself in the habit of pretending to be someone, so as not to reveal his condition of being no one; in London, he found the profession to which he was predestined, that of an actor, who on a stage, pretends to be another before an assembly of people who pretend to accept him as that other. The theatrical tasks taught him a peculiar happiness, perhaps the first he ever knew; but after the final verse was acclaimed and the last dead character removed from the stage, the despised taste of unreality fell upon him. He ceased to be Ferrex or Tamburlaine, and returned to being no one. Harassed, he began to imagine other heroes and other tragic fables. Thus, while his body fulfilled its corporeal destiny in the brothels and taverns of London, the soul inhabiting him was Caesar, who ignores the augur's warning, and Juliet, who abhors the lark, and Macbeth, who converses on the moor with witches who are also the Fates. No one was as many men as this man, who, like the Egyptian Proteus, could exhaust all the forms of being. Sometimes, he left a confession in some corner of a play, sure that it would go undiscovered; Richard proclaims that in his single person, he plays many roles, and Iago declares with curious words, "I am not what I am". The fundamental identity of existence, dreaming, and acting inspired famous passages.

For twenty years he persisted in that directed hallucination, but one morning he was overtaken by the weariness and horror of being so many kings dying by the sword and so many woeful lovers who converge, diverge, and melodiously agonize. That same day, he resolved to sell his theatre. Within a week, he had returned to his hometown, where he rediscovered the trees and the river of his childhood, and did not connect them to those others that his muse had celebrated, illustrious in mythological allusion and Latin voices. He had to be someone; he became a retired entrepreneur who had made a fortune and was interested in loans, litigations, and petty usury. In this character, he dictated the barren will that we know, deliberately excluding any trace of pathos or literature. Friends from London would often visit his retirement, and for them, he would resume the role of the poet.

History adds that before or after death, he found himself before God and said, "I, who have been so many men in vain, want to be one and myself". The voice of God answered him from a whirlwind: "I too am not; I dreamed the world just as you dreamed your work, my Shakespeare, and among the forms of my dream was you, who like me are many and no one".
