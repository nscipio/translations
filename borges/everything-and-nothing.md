In him, there was no one; behind his face (which, even through the flawed paintings of the time, bears no resemblance to any other) and his words, which were copious, fantastical, and agitated, there was nothing but a touch of cold, a dream un-dreamed by anyone. Initially, he thought all people were like him, but the bewilderment of a companion with whom he had begun discussing this void revealed his error and left him with the eternal realization that an individual should not diverge from their species. He once thought that in books he would find a remedy for his plight, and so he learned the scant Latin and even lesser Greek that a contemporary might speak; then he considered that in the practice of an elemental rite of humanity, he could find what he was seeking, and he allowed himself to be initiated by Anne Hathaway during a long June siesta. In his early twenties, he went to London. Instinctively, he had already trained himself in the habit of pretending to be someone, so his condition of being no one would not be discovered; in London, he found the profession to which he was predestined, that of an actor, who on a stage, plays another, before a gathering of people who pretend to take him for that other. The theatrical tasks taught him a singular happiness, perhaps the first he knew; but after the last verse was acclaimed and the last dead character was removed from the stage, the detested taste of unreality fell upon him. He ceased to be Ferrex or Tamburlaine, and returned to being no one. Harassed, he began to imagine other heroes and other tragic tales. Thus, while his body fulfilled its destiny in the brothels and taverns of London, the soul that inhabited him was Caesar, who disregards the augur's warning, and Juliet, who abhors the lark, and Macbeth, who converses on the moor with the witches who are also the Fates. No one was as many men as this man, who, like the Egyptian Proteus, could exhaust all the appearances of being. Sometimes, he left a confession in some corner of a play, certain that it would remain undeciphered; Richard claims that in his single person, he plays many roles, and Iago says with curious words, "I am not what I am". The fundamental identity of existing, dreaming, and acting inspired his famous passages.

For twenty years, he persisted in that deliberate illusion, but one morning he was struck by the fatigue and horror of being so many kings dying by the sword, and so many wretched lovers who converge, diverge, and melodiously agonize. That same day, he resolved to sell his theatre. Before a week had passed, he had returned to his hometown, where he reconnected with the trees and the river of his childhood, and did not associate them with those others his muse had celebrated, illustrious with mythological allusion and Latin voices. He had to be someone; he became a retired businessman who had amassed a fortune and took interest in loans, lawsuits, and small-scale usury. In this role, he dictated the barren last testament of will that we know, deliberately excluding any hint of pathos or literature. Friends from London would often visit his retirement, and for them, he resumed the role of the poet.

History adds that, before or after death, he found himself before God and said, "I, who have been so many men in vain, want to be one and myself". The voice of God replied from a whirlwind: "I, too, am not; I dreamed the world just as you dreamed your work, my Shakespeare, and among the forms of my dream, you were there, who, like me, are many and no one".
