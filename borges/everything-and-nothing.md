# "Everything and Nothing" by Jorge Luis Borges - English Translation by Nicholas Scipione

In him, there was nobody; behind his face, one that bore no resemblance to any other even in the flawed paintings of the time, and his words, abundant, fantastical, and animated, there was nothing but a hint of coldness, a dream dreamt by no one. Initially, he thought all people were just like him, but the surprise of a friend, to whom he had started to reveal his emptiness, uncovered his mistake and ingrained in him the everlasting belief that an individual should not deviate from their species. He once thought he might find a remedy for his malaise in books, and so learned the "little Latin and less Greek" as a contemporary would later note; then he considered that what he sought might be found in the practice of a basic human ritual, allowing himself to be guided by Anne Hathaway through a long afternoon siesta in June. In his early twenties, he moved to London. Instinctively, he had already trained himself in the habit of pretending to be someone, to mask his condition of being nobody; in London, he found the profession he was predestined for - that of an actor, who on a stage, pretends to be someone else before an audience who play along. The theatrical tasks offered him a unique kind of happiness, perhaps the first he'd ever known; but once the last verse was applauded and the final death removed from the stage, the despised taste of unreality loomed over him again. He ceased to be Ferrex or Tamburlaine and reverted to being no one. Under pressure, he started to conjure other heroes and other tragic tales. Thus, while his body fulfilled its earthly destiny in the brothels and taverns of London, the soul that inhabited him was Caesar, who ignored the augur's warning, Juliet, who abhorred the lark, and Macbeth, who conversed on the moor with the witches who were also the Fates. No one was as multifaceted as this man, who, like the Egyptian Proteus, could exhaust all forms of being. Occasionally, he'd leave a confession in some obscure corner of his work, certain it wouldn't be deciphered; Richard asserts that in his single persona, he plays many roles, and Iago enigmatically states “I am not what I am.” The fundamental identity of existing, dreaming, and acting inspired his renowned passages.

For twenty years, he maintained this orchestrated hallucination until one morning he was struck by the ennui and horror of being so many kings who fell by the sword, so many star-crossed lovers who met, separated, and agonized in melody. That very day, he decided to sell his theater. Before a week had passed, he returned to his hometown, where he reconnected with the trees and the river of his childhood, unlinked from those others his muse had once lauded, steeped in mythological allusions and Latin phrases. He had to be someone; so he became a retired entrepreneur who'd made his fortune and took interest in loans, legal disputes, and minor usury. In this persona, he composed the dry will we now know, deliberately void of any emotional or literary trace. Friends from London would visit his seclusion, and for them, he'd resume his role as the poet.

The story further adds that before or after his death, he found himself before God and said: "I, who have been so many men in vain, wish to be one, and myself." The voice of God responded from a whirlwind: "Neither am I; I dreamed the world as you dreamed your work, my Shakespeare, and amongst the shapes of my dream were you, who like me, are many and nobody."
