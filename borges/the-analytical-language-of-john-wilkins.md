# The Analytical Language of John Wilkins

By Jorge Luis Borges

---

I have confirmed that the fourteenth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica omits the article on John Wilkins. This omission is just, if we remember the triviality of the article (twenty lines of mere biographical circumstances: Wilkins was born in 1614, Wilkins died in 1672, Wilkins was chaplain to Charles Louis, an Italian prince; Wilkins was appointed rector of one of the Oxford colleges, Wilkins was the first secretary of the Royal Society of London, etc.); it is culpable, if we consider the speculative work of Wilkins. He indulged in a multitude of delightful curiosities: he was interested in theology, cryptography, music, the creation of transparent beehives, the trajectory of an unseen planet, the possibility of a lunar journey, and the possibility and principles of a universal language. To this last problem, he dedicated the book 'An Essay Towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language' (600 pages in large quarto, 1668). There are no copies of this book in our National Library; In order to write this article, I have consulted, 'The Life and Times of John Wilkins' (1910) by P. A. Wright Henderson; the 'Woertebuch der Philosophie' (1924) by Fritz Mathner; 'Delphos' (1935) by E. Sylvia Pankhurst; and 'Dangerous Thoughts' (1939) by Lancelot Hogben.
