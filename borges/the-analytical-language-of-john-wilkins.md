# The Analytical Language of John Wilkins

By Jorge Luis Borges

---

I have verified that the fourteenth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica omits the article on John Wilkins. This omission is justified if we remember the triviality of the article (twenty lines of mere biographical circumstances: Wilkins was born in 1614, Wilkins died in 1672, Wilkins was chaplain to Charles Louis, an Italian prince; Wilkins was appointed rector of one of the Oxford colleges, Wilkins was the first secretary of the Royal Society of London, etc.). It is culpable if we consider Wilkins' speculative work. He abounded in happy curiosities: theology, cryptography, music, the manufacture of transparent beehives, the course of an invisible planet, the possibility of a voyage to the moon, the possibility and principles of a universal language interested him. To this last problem, he dedicated the book "An Essay Towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language" (600 quarto pages, 1668). There are no copies of that book in our National Library. To write this note, I have consulted "The Life and Times of John Wilkins" (1910) by P.A. Wright Henderson, "Woerterbuch der Philosophie" (1924) by Fritz Mauthner, "Delphos" (1935) by E. Sylvia Pankhurst, and "Dangerous Thoughts" (1939) by Lancelot Hogben.
