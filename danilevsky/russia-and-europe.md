# Russia and Europe

By Nikolai Iakovlevich Danilevskii

In the summer of 1866, an event of significant historical importance took place. Germany, which had been fragmented for centuries, began to unite under the leadership of a brilliant Prussian minister [^1], forming a single powerful entity. The European status quo, obviously, has been violated, and this violation will certainly not stop at what we have recently witnessed. The cunningly arranged political machine, whose movement was so carefully regulated, turned out to be disintegrated. Everyone knows that the events of 1866 were only the natural consequence of the events of 1864. Then, in fact, the disintegration of the political-diplomatic machine took place, although it did not attract the necessary attention of those appointed to monitor it. However important the consequences of the Austro-Prussian-Danish war of 1864 may be, I do not intend to focus on this side of them to attract the attention of the readers.
