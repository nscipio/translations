## Chapter I: The Years 1864 and 1854: Initial Observations and Historical Context.

In this introductory section, we delve into the historical significance of the years 1864 and 1854, setting the stage for our exploration of the relationship between Russia and Europe. We examine the complex dynamics that unfolded during these periods, analyzing their global impact and evaluating the roles played by various European powers. Additionally, we consider the Western perspective, particularly Britain's interests, and scrutinize the influential role of the Crimean War in shaping historical events. Finally, we address the underlying reasons that led to the outbreak of the war.

In the summer of 1866, a historically significant event occurred. Germany, which had been divided for centuries, began its unification under the guidance of a brilliant Prussian minister[^1], forming a powerful and cohesive entity. This development disrupted the established European order, and its impact was anticipated to surpass previous observations. The meticulously constructed political machinery, previously regulated with care, revealed its fragility. It is widely acknowledged that the events of 1866 were a natural consequence of the preceding events in 1864. During that time, the disintegration of the political and diplomatic apparatus occurred, although it went largely unnoticed by those responsible for monitoring it. While the consequences of the Austro-Prussian-Danish war of 1864 may hold significance, our focus is not to captivate readers' attention on that aspect.

As I encountered this event during that summer, it unfolded organically, like a series of interconnected occurrences, reflecting the various stages of its development. In the present era, we witness similar phenomena manifesting in different ways. In 1864, Denmark and Austria, as initial participants, engaged in a conflict involving approximately 60 million individuals, resulting in significant territorial changes. One notable consequence was the transfer of Schleswig, a disputed territory, to Prussia, a prevailing power with substantial political and military influence. Among other events, this occurrence constituted a complex, multifaceted, and historically significant episode in European affairs. These events are intertwined with the major powers of Europe, powers that have increasingly played pivotal roles in shaping European affairs and have emerged as central figures in the rivalry between France and Germany, the two powers most directly involved in this contention[^2]. It is this highly significant event, leaving no room for doubt, that fundamentally alters the course of historical development. The unification of Germany, as it unfolded, represents not only a triumph for Prussia and a display of military prowess but also the realization of a national ideal and the fulfillment of a long-held aspiration. Such is the essence of what transpired in 1864.
