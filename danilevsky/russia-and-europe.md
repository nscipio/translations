## Chapter I: The Years 1864 and 1854: Initial Observations and Historical Context.

*Comparison of two years. — Europe's equal-mindedness towards Denmark and sympathy for Turkey. The Schleswig question. — The Eastern War; significance of the keys to the Wiflemsky church. The Vienna Note; the political image of Europe's actions translated into the sphere of private relations. — Public opinion in Europe. — Where does the measure of different measures come from?*

In the summer of 1866, an event of historical significance occurred. After centuries of division, Germany started its unification under the guidance of a brilliant Prussian minister[^1], forming a powerful and cohesive nation. This seismic shift disrupted the established European order and was anticipated to create a larger impact than previous political realignments. The carefully constructed political mechanisms, previously maintained with diligent oversight, revealed their fragility. It's widely recognized that the events of 1866 were the natural consequence of the preceding events of 1864, which had seen the crumbling of diplomatic structures - a process that largely went unnoticed by the powers that be.

While the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian-Danish War in 1864 holds historical significance, it's not my aim to focus on these details and captivate the readers' attention solely on this aspect. As I look back on that summer, the event unfolded organically, like a tapestry of interconnected occurrences, each thread marking a stage in the development of this major historical shift. Today, we witness similar phenomena in various shapes and forms.

In 1864, Denmark and Austria, two principal actors, initiated a conflict involving nearly 60 million people, causing significant changes in territories. A notable consequence was the annexation of the disputed territory of Schleswig by Prussia, an emerging power with substantial political and military influence. Among other developments, this episode represented a complex and historically significant chapter in the annals of European politics.

The unification of Germany under Prussia's lead not only represented a military victory but also signified the fulfillment of a national ambition. It brought about a tectonic shift in the course of historical development. This is the true essence of what transpired in 1864.

Over time, the involvement of major European powers has become increasingly prominent, playing pivotal roles in shaping European affairs. They have emerged as central figures in the rivalry between France and Germany, the two powers most directly embroiled in this contention[^2]. This significant event not only led to a fundamental shift in the trajectory of historical progression but also led to the realization of national ideals and the fulfillment of long-held aspirations.

The unification of Germany signified a triumph for Prussia and also marked the realization of a national ideal and the fulfillment of a deeply-held aspiration. The unification also involved major powers of Europe who played increasingly pivotal roles in shaping European affairs, emerging as central figures in the rivalry between France and Germany, the two most directly involved powers in the contention.

These intricate relationships within the European theatre and the broader international sphere marked the start of an era of complex diplomatic maneuvering. In 1854, at the start of the Crimean War, the spotlight fell on Austria and Prussia. However, it was Russia who emerged as a key player, with France and England also playing critical roles. These developments shaped the course of European history. It's indeed a complex issue, deserving of a thorough analysis, encompassing both historical and contemporary perspectives, and considering the intricate interplay of powers and non-state actors at play. The deeper motivations and dynamics that led Russia to get involved in the Crimean War cannot be overlooked. Indeed, it's not a straightforward narrative. The interplay of these events deserves nuanced understanding and exploration of different dimensions.

[^1]: By the term 'genius Prussian minister,' Danilevsky refers to Otto von Bismarck (1815-1898), who, while holding the position of minister-president of the most powerful German state, pursued a policy of unifying Germany 'by iron and blood.' The Austro-Prussian War of 1866 was the first major step in this direction.

[^2]: In early 1852, representatives of the five great powers (England, France, Russia, Austria, and Prussia) signed a treaty in London that guaranteed the integrity of the Danish monarchy. In accordance with this, the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein recognized the authority of the Danish crown and were cleared of the German troops previously stationed there.
