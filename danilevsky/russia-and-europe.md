## Chapter I: The Years 1864 and 1854: Initial Observations and Historical Context.

*Comparison of two years. — Europe's equal-mindedness towards Denmark and sympathy for Turkey. The Schleswig question. — The Eastern War; significance of the keys to the Wiflemsky church. The Vienna Note; the political image of Europe's actions translated into the sphere of private relations. — Public opinion in Europe. — Where does the measure of different measures come from?*

In the summer of 1866, an event of immense historical significance unfolded. Germany, which had been fragmented over the centuries, began consolidating under the astute leadership of a brilliant Prussian minister[^1]. This unity challenged the prevailing status quo in Europe, causing ripples that extended beyond the immediate sphere. A carefully constructed political machine, previously operating with delicate balance, found itself derailed. It is widely acknowledged that the occurrences of 1866 were a natural outgrowth of the events that transpired in 1864. That was the year the disruption of the political-diplomatic machine actually took place, despite it largely escaping the watchful eyes assigned to its oversight. However significant the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian-Danish war of 1864 might be, I do not wish to divert the reader's focus onto that aspect.

In the two years that serve as the titular focus of this chapter, a decade apart, a pair of events unfolded that held an extraordinary amount of insight for any Russian able and willing to discern the meaning and significance of ongoing affairs. Presented in a condensed form, the events of these years unfolded as follows. In 1864, Prussia and Austria, two premier states boasting a combined population of about 60,000,000 and a near-million strong army, assailed Denmark, one of Europe's smallest states, inhabited by a mere two and a half million people. This was a state characterized by its innovative, enlightened, liberal, and humane policies to the highest degree. From Denmark, they seized two provinces that constituted two-fifths of its population. These provinces, the ties to which with Denmark had been affirmed just thirteen years prior by the London Treaty—endorsed, among others, by the attacking states[^2]—saw their direct violation of the treaty met with no resistance. Neither the affront to the moral sensibilities nor the disruption to the so-called political balance sparked any significant backlash from Europe, neither from its public sentiment nor its governments. Not enough to move from mere rhetoric to concrete action, at least. Thus, the annexation of Danish territories was carried out with little fuss. This encapsulates the events of 1864.

Eleven years prior, Russia, a nation considered part of the European political system and notable for its size and power, was slighted in its most sacred interests (specifically in religious aspects) by Turkey. Turkey, a nation characterized by its barbaric, aggressive posture, although already weakened, still sustains its unlawful and unjust rule primarily through force. At the time, Turkey was not fully incorporated into Europe's political system, and its integrity had not been safeguarded by any advantageous treaty. Yet, this integrity was largely disregarded by others. The only requirement imposed on Turkey was to explicitly and affirmatively assure its commitment not to violate the religious rights of the majority of its own citizens. This was not a new obligation; it was solemnly committed to eighty years earlier in the Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainardji[^3].

Strikingly, this justifiable demand, acknowledged by the diplomatic assembly of first-tier European states, left the religious and other interests of millions of Christians in a state of uncertainty. And, oddly enough, Europe began to view this same barbaric state as a beacon of civilization and freedom.

In 1854, just ten years prior to the dissection of Denmark, which had drawn little attention, England and France declared war on Russia. Sardinia was drawn into the conflict, Austria took on a threatening stance, and eventually, the entirety of Europe threatened war if Russia did not accept the unfavorable terms of peace proposed to it. This is the conduct displayed by Europe's governments. Interestingly, even European public opinion seemed more ardent, ready to incite even those governments, like Russia and certain German states, which due to various reservations, did not desire a rupture with Russia.

Where does this preferential treatment towards the humane, liberal Denmark and sympathy towards barbaric, despotic Turkey originate? Why the leniency towards Austria's unjust demands on Prussia, and the total disregard for Russia's most lawful demands? The matter merits exploration. This is not some random occurrence, not a journalistic outburst, not a whim of any political party, but a collective diplomatic action of all Europe, representing a sentiment less likely than most to be influenced by momentary passion or unconsidered fascination. Therefore, I chose it as the starting point for the proposed examination of the mutual relations between Europe and Russia.

Firstly, we need to examine if there's any overt provocation in Denmark's relations with Prussia and Austria, in other words, anything that could justify in the eyes of Europe this strong-arming of the weak. Conversely, we must investigate if there are any actions from Russia that have affronted Europe, thus provoking its righteous indignation and disapproval?

We will not delve into the intricacies of the Schleswig-Holstein dispute between Germany and Denmark, a dispute that, as is well-known, lasted for a lengthy seventeen years and, I believe, is of minimal interest to Russian readers. The crux of the matter is that Denmark established a universal constitution for all its constituent parts - one of the most liberal constitutions in Europe, inherently disallowing the subjugation of one nationality by another. However, Germany sought something different: it demanded a distinct constitution for Holstein, one that would be notably inferior but decisively differentiate this region from the rest of the monarchy.

But the essence of the Schleswig-Holstein dispute lies elsewhere: it revolved around whether it should belong to Denmark and, if so, on what terms. Germany, on the other hand, had a different agenda. It demanded a separate constitution for Holstein, one that would be noticeably inferior but would decisively set this region apart from the rest of the monarchy. It sought not merely a personal union like that of Sweden and Norway (which would have been insignificant), but a specific implementation of provincial law that would grant Holstein officials the authority to nullify the effectiveness of any legislation passed for Denmark as a whole[^4]. That is the true crux of the Schleswig-Holstein question.

However, Germany pursued a different approach to the Schleswig-Holstein question, specifically emphasizing its historical connection to the Duchy and asserting its own influence over all Danish affairs. This policy led to tensions and ultimately culminated in the Second Schleswig War[^5], during which both Denmark and Prussia became involved in a protracted and devastating conflict, resulting in significant territorial and political changes that fundamentally altered the regional power dynamics.

Amidst the complexities and competing interests of various parties, Holstein unexpectedly emerged as a player in its own right, exerting influence not only on the international stage but also in regional affairs. This gave rise to a period of ambiguity, as Holstein's alignment with either Denmark or Prussia was not clearly defined. However, it is undeniable that during this transitional phase, certain actions (attributed to influential individuals) were influenced by Germany, though not necessarily in a coordinated or unified manner. Holstein, with its distinct position, played a significant role in shaping the course of events that were intricately intertwined with Germany's broader aspirations.

[^1]: By the term 'genius Prussian minister,' Danilevsky refers to Otto von Bismarck (1815-1898), who, while holding the position of minister-president of the most powerful German state, pursued a policy of unifying Germany 'by iron and blood.' The Austro-Prussian War of 1866 was the first major step in this direction.

[^2]: In early 1852, representatives of the five great powers (England, France, Russia, Austria, and Prussia) signed a treaty in London that guaranteed the integrity of the Danish monarchy. In accordance with this, the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein recognized the authority of the Danish crown and were cleared of the German troops previously stationed there.

[^3] The Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainardji, signed on July 10, 1774, marked the end of the Russo-Turkish War of 1768-1774. As a consequence of this treaty, Russia gained control over Kerch in Crimea, parts of the Dniester Liman coast, and Kabarda. This agreement transformed Russia into a Black Sea power and significantly bolstered its position in the Transcaucasus and the Balkans.
