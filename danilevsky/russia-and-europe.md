# Russia and Europe

By Nikolay Yakovlevich Danilevsky

In the summer of 1866, a historically significant event occurred. Germany, which had been divided for centuries, began to unite under the guidance of a brilliant Prussian minister [^1], forming a powerful and unified entity. This development disrupted the established European order, and it was clear that the impact would extend beyond what had been observed thus far. The carefully constructed political machinery, which had been carefully regulated, turned out to be disintegrated. It is widely known that the events of 1866 were a natural consequence of the events that took place in 1864. At that time, the disintegration of the political and diplomatic apparatus occurred, although it did not receive the necessary attention from those responsible for monitoring it. While the consequences of the Austro-Prussian-Danish war of 1864 may be important, I do not intend to focus on that aspect in order to captivate the readers' attention.

In the summer, during which I encountered this event, it emerged naturally, like a sequence of connected events, reflecting its various stages of development. In the present era, similar phenomena manifest in different ways. In 1864, Denmark and Austria, as initial participants, engaged in a conflict involving approximately 60,000,000 individuals and resulting in significant territorial changes. One consequence was the transfer of Schleswig, a disputed territory, to Prussia, a prevailing power with significant political and military influence. This event, among others, constituted a complex, multifaceted, and historically significant episode in European affairs. These events are linked to the major powers of Europe, powers that have played an increasingly important role in shaping European affairs and have become central figures in the rivalry between France and Germany, the two powers most directly involved in this rivalry [^2]. And it is this highly significant event, one that leaves no room for doubt, that fundamentally alters the course of historical development. The unification of Germany, as it occurred, represents not only a victory for Prussia and a triumph of military power but also the realization of a national ideal and the fulfillment of a long-held aspiration. This is the essence of what transpired in 1864.
